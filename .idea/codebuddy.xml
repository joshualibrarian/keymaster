        <option value="Please consolidate and cleanup this entire set of documents, some of which I wrote that are different versions of the same thing, and some are ChatGPT generated based on my documents." />
        <option value="Yes, finalize two USB-C ports + MicroSD slot.  The LED isn't optional, but is so minor anyway, and is highly configurable.&#10;&#10;For some of the specifics of the encryption schemes, I'd like to slightly generalize... because I don't completely understand the cryptographic references, so I'd like it to be a bit more tentative, and just specify more broadly, and less specifically (possibly with some examples like is now there, as needed).  The final decisions on those things will need to be made with the engineering team actually designing the thing.&#10;&#10;I'm not entirely sure the &quot;death protocol&quot; thing is viable.  Let's table that for a side discussion, but just leave it as a stub in the documentation.  It seems like it would be very easy to trick the backup device into triggering, just with the date, but the results will still be encrypted to the recipient... might still be worth doing, perhaps we need to discuss.&#10;&#10;There's no &quot;quickstart&quot;, this device DOES NOT EXIST.  I have created this vision for it and will find a firm to design and build it based on the design specs we're producing. But yes, README should be overview, key features, etc.&#10;&#10;I'd like to keep most of the &quot;pitch&quot; in the README, since often that's all I'll get someone to read... I'm not sure if vision needs to be an additional document, or not... maybe README is vision, and then we have a separate overview?  I'm open to better ideas though...&#10;&#10;The only feature definitely pushed into a potential v2 is the fingerprint reader... MAYBE some simple NFC wireless, but I doubt it.  The presence of an SE and the use a bulk storag should be options.&#10;&#10;Oooh, &quot;legacy release&quot; is a great name.  I think I've answered all your key decisions there.  Take that all into account, and I've given you access to the whole codebase and filetree.&#10;&#10;Make it so." />
        <option value="The plan sounded good, but I applied your changes and you removed a LOT of my narrative and description.  It's too brief now, too curt... it needs to be a BIT more conversational and narrative-driven.  It needs to DISCUSS the problem, some existing solutions, and why this device solves them, just a bit more.  And there's a LOT of empty stubs there.  Please try and fill a bunch of them in.  Rescan the whole project, please I've deleted a bunch of stuff you left empty and renamed some things...&#10;&#10;Also, re: the case, I want to shoot for IP67 environmental resistance.&#10;&#10;Yeah, the whole thing is just too sparse now, please bulk it out with more content based on my original text!  Put some of that back!" />
        <option value="7. no, that's not for now, but addressing why no battery might be worth doing somewhere.&#10;&#10;8. Yes, keep it clear, but don't belabor the point (that it doesn't exist yet).  The whole thing should feel like a spec/proposal/vision, not a product.&#10;&#10;I'm willing compromise on the IP67 specifically if it adds too much complication to v1 (but go for as close as practical).  However, yes the SD must be relatively accessible, but can be behind a little door or gasket or something, I think.&#10;&#10;Stay vague on licensing, but it should be broadly &quot;open source&quot;.  In software bit, be sure to put the vault file structure example back, I thought that got it across well." />
        <option value="If there's a door on the MicroSD slot, it should be hinged so not easily lost, and with a latch.  Yes, mentioning existing products for comparison is fine.  Yes, public partitions are optional and not enabled by default.  It's important that this device be VERY compatable with phones, in general.  Do they mostly accept HID input?  No FAQ needed..." />
        <option value="You still left a bunch of stuff empty... and why is it constantly saying &quot;conversation ended&quot;... what does that even mean?  Do you loose context?" />
        <option value="1. Yes, hardware.md, and the other can just be deleted.  Keep the name, but add a note somewhere that we're open to better names.  V1 has everything EXCEPT secure chip and fingerprint reader, or ANY wireless.  It should have bulk storage as option, and SC comes in v2 for sure.&#10;2. It should have the most flexible possible smart-card handling, that is v1.  Mouse probably not needed, but it's just software on the AP, so could be added later, right?&#10;&#10;Otherwise, looks good.  Bulk it out some." />
        <option value="Yes, please focus on the readme.  It needs a lot more.  Make it a professional, but narrative style." />
        <option value="You are a brilliant editor and electronics expert who knows everything about encrytpion and digital security.&#10;&#10;Please take a deep breath and process this entire repository and the link attached here.  This hard about this one.&#10;&#10;Several iterations of AI have utterly mangled this set of project documentation, and I'd like to see if you can fix it.  This began with the sort of &quot;vision&quot; document that I wrote, which you can see the original of here:&#10;&#10;https://github.com/joshualibrarian/keymaster/edit/main/README.md&#10;&#10;I would like you to largely restore the README file in this repo with the original content from the github version, but please edit and pair it down a BIT.&#10;&#10;The rest of the repo should contain a robust and clear TECHNICAL description of this device, &#10;such that I can give it to an engineering firm for a proper quote and get a good sense of what it will cost to develop.&#10;&#10;Please organize and consolidate everything, there should only be:&#10;&#10;* README.md - the non-technical &quot;vision&quot; document describing the device and it's broad usage&#10;&#10;* hardware.md - a concise run down of the technical hardware requirements for an engineering team.  It needn't specify EVERYTHING exactly, there should be room for final design decisions by that team, more of a broad design draft&#10;&#10;* software - a breakdown of all the different software that will be needed for this, firmware, and AP code, and the whole vault integration format.&#10;&#10;* examples - there should be like a dozen &quot;narrative&quot; examples of use, like tell a little story about someone using the device in variously different ways/environments/situations/devices..." />
        <option value="Your README is too short and lacks some critical features!  The fact that you can unlock it hidden is a primary feature, to empower some security culture... also it has to give more about WHY we need this." />
        <option value="I like this plan.  Also add a bit about the synchronizing and backing up of your data, how we will have an option to have significant storage on the device (1-2 TB), so one could keep all their data on them and secure at all times, and still backed up to their home device automatically.&#10;&#10;Add that, then yes, make it so!" />
