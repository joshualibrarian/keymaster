- durable case
  - made of metal and as strong as feasible
  - as waterproof as possible
  - a very strong hole on one end for attaching a chain or cord
  - an attached, waterproof cap for USB-C port

- twelve-key keypad
  - arranged in a four by three grid, like an old phone
  - capacitance keys require actual touch and have no movement
  - the keys are each inset
    - this is critical to the design to empower security culture
    - users are encouraged to learn the pattern of their code, to enter it by touch
    - code should always be entered out of sight to minimize risk of exposure
  - unlock code can be arbitrary length and contain both regular presses and long presses
  - once unlocked, keys are used to navigate menus shown on display
  - available functions can be configured on a per-host basis
  
- display
  - e-ink display can maintain image when unplugged
  - primarily used after unlocking to navigate functions on device with buttons beneath display
  - possibly fingerprint scanner on surface of screen?

- special storage for GPG master keys
  - one for each profile
  - secure storage chip
  - accessed infrequently for maintenance
  - requires unlocked device to access
  - requires master passphrase to decrypt
  - master key used to sign other keys

- bulk storage vault
  - significant size (~ 1GB?)
  - entries can be any kind of data
    - usernames, passwords, verification questions and answers
    - private keys (GPG, SSH, cryptocurrency, or any other)
    - bank account and card numbers
    - private contacts with public keys
    - secret documents
  - entries can contain an auto-type pattern
  - each entry stored on device separately encrypted
  - entries can be shared across profiles
  - arbitrary groups of entries can be specified
  - something like proxy re-encryption used to access only specific entries assigned to various groups
  - specific hosts only have access to assigned groups of entries
  - unknown hosts can be assigned some entries (Netflix or the like)
  - when unlocked on a host, a volume with all specified grouped entries is dynamically generated and mounted
  - the generation of entries should be scriptable so certain entries can be presented specially for connecting software

- software password manager
  - signed binaries of software for various platforms can be stored on device and run directly from it
  - the software should access the entries directly from the device and never write them anywhere else
  - can cache some entries, so they remain in memory for a specified time after device is removed
  - various connectors needed to access entries conveniently in various contexts
    - plugins for web browsers to enter usernames, passwords, credit card numbers
    - implementations of agents like ssh-agent and gpg-agent
    - integration into cryptocurrency wallets
    - eventually integration into various operating systems
    - auto type pattern can be used as fallback

- smart card functionality
  - a challenge-response mechanism is ideal, since the secret key never leaves the device
  - any entry with a secret key may be configured to be accessible with various smart card protocols
  - on many platforms, this can be used for authentication
  - with an adapter, the device can be used directly on smart-card readers such as in retail devices
    - is power provided to smart cards sufficient to run device?
    - if not, low power mode is needed with minimal functionality

- security key functionality
  - device should support various FIDO protocols
  - should support TOTP protocols
    - device has no battery
    - accessing the current time will have to happen either through the host system or the network

- backup mode
  - devices usually sold in pairs (though singles available)
  - multiple backup units can be used simultaneously
  - when device is activated in backup mode, it is meant to remain in a host
  - when data on active unit changes, it attempts to automatically sync with backup unit
  - if on the same host, it is synchronized directly
  - if over a network, synchronization takes place through an encrypted tunnel
  - both the active and backup units can emulate a network device directly
  - the backup unit can be plugged (through adapter) directly into and powered by an ethernet port

- protocol for the death of the user
  - each time the user unlocks the active unit, it may attempt to contact the backup unit over the network
  - the backup unit can be configured to expect these regular check-ins from the active unit
  - each entry may have a beneficiary specified by public key
  - after a specified period without contact from the active unit, a backup unit may activate a death protocol
  - when the backup unit activates the death protocol, the given beneficiaries are given access to the entries
    - the entries could then be bequeathed directly to the active unit of each beneficiary
    - email, or some other notifications could be specified
    - this process should be scriptable for maximum flexibility
